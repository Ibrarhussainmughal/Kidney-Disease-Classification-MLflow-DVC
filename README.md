# Kidney Disease Classification — End-to-End ML System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **production-style end-to-end machine learning pipeline** to classify
the presence of kidney disease based on clinical features.

The focus is not only on model accuracy, but on building a **reproducible, maintainable, and scalable ML system**
using modern MLOps practices.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Early detection of kidney disease is critical for effective treatment.
This system uses machine learning to classify patient records and assist in early diagnosis.

---

## 🧠 Solution Approach
The project follows a structured ML workflow:

1. Data ingestion with version control (DVC)
2. Data preprocessing and feature engineering
3. Model training and evaluation
4. Experiment tracking using MLflow
5. Reproducible pipelines with configuration management
